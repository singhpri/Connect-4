# Connect-4

This is the final project of the course Java programming offered by Udacity.  In this project, I have created the agent "myAgent".
I have learned many fundamental data structures and Object Oriented design concepts such as polymorphism and encapsulation
in this course.
## To play the game
 Go to Main.java and set one (or both) of the players in the game to 'MyAgent'. This will allow 'MyAgent' to play the game. Then, run Main, and watch the agent play.
